// never hears them. The list behind -[NSWorkspace runningApplications] is the
// one that bites hardest: measured in go-macos/accessibility, an application
// launched a moment earlier appeared within 500 ms with a 50 ms pump, and was
// STILL invisible fifteen seconds later without it — and would have stayed
// invisible for the life of the process, because the list is a cache and the
// cache is only ever refreshed by those notifications.
//
// A library cannot require its caller to run an AppKit run loop. This is the
// smallest thing it can do instead, and it belongs here rather than being bound
// again in every package that meets the problem.
//
// It is not a substitute for [Run] or [DispatchMain]: it services whatever is
// attached to the CURRENT thread's run loop and returns. A negative or zero
// duration returns at once, having done nothing.
